# Building a Gemini Image Editor: Harnessing AI for Creative Image Transformation

In today's rapidly evolving AI landscape, the ability to manipulate and transform images using natural language has become increasingly accessible to developers. This tutorial will guide you through building a modern web application that leverages Google's Gemini AI to edit images based on text instructions.

## What We're Building

The Gemini Image Editor is a sleek, user-friendly web application that allows users to:

- Upload an image
- Provide natural language instructions for editing
- Generate a transformed version using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp Image Generation model

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Image Editing**: Transform images using simple text instructions
- **Real-time Generation**: Watch as your edited images appear before your eyes
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, minimal interface with smooth animations
- **Single-Screen Layout**: View both input and output simultaneously
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark Mode Support**: Automatically adapts to system preferences
- **Secure API Key Handling**: Your API key is stored only in memory, never persisted

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher installed
- A Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)
- The "Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp Image Generation" model enabled in your Google AI Studio project

## Project Setup

Let's start by creating a new project. We'll use Next.js for its excellent developer experience and built-in API routes.
